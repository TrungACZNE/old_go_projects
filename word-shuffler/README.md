Word shuffler
=====

I don't exactly remember what this is called, but basically it creates random permutations of a particular text file, usually used by email spammers. Might have other legitimate uses.

Usage

```
$ echo "Hello {world,friend}" | word-shuffler
Hello world
$ echo "Hello {world,friend}" | word-shuffler
Hello friend
```

(the output is random of course)
